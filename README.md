## About
I made it using Symfony, TWIG template, CSS3, JavaScript and PHP 8

You will find : 
- Register form
- Login form
- Sessions'list (future sessions, progress sessions, passed sessions )
- Training's list
- Trainer's list
- List of categories
- List of trainees
- The possibility to add a training / category / trainee / trainer / programm..
- Add a trainee / programm to a session
- Remove a trainee / programm from a session
- Success messages (displayed during few seconds thanks to JavaScript)

You can't access the pages if you are not logged in. You can register to create an account.


To see the project you'll have to run symfony server, and you can for example, put this link :
http://127.0.0.1:8000/login


If you want a database, you can use the one I've put in the project files.
